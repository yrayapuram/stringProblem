# stringProblem

Define a Java class to solve this problem:<br>
Given a String and a Character, remove all instances of the Character in the String

Solve this two ways:<br>
1. Iterate through the String, one character at a time<br>
2. Find a method in the String class that can solve this in one line<br>

Write methods for each solution.

Afterwards, write a TestNG or JUnit class for each solution which tests these methods.<br>
Include both positive and negative cases for validations.
